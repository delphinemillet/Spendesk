# Manage users feature

Interface to manage a list of users

**Expected files: CSV with coma separator**

> final application link: https://delphinemillet.github.io/manage-users/

## Prerequisites

```
node v8.9+
yarn v1.3+
```

## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn start
```

### Runs tests

```
yarn test
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

## Structure

- `screens`: app pages
- `components`: atomic component
- `redux`: store, actions and reducers

## Difficulties encountered

- don't know how to create a CSV file
- lost a lot of time trying to test the import file action (its parsing was the most critical part according to me)
- not enough time to implement more user stories
